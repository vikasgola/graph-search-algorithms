# graph-search-algorithms
This repo contains all the search algorithms of graph. All search run on connected graph with 10000000 nodes and approx. 20000000 edges.

## Requirements
- Matplotlib
- numpy

## Implemented Algorithms
- UCS: uniform cost search
- BestFS: best first search
- A*: A * Algorithm
- SHCS:  simple hill climbing search
- SAHCS: steepest ascent hill climbing search
- DFS: Depth First Search
- BFS: Bredth First Search
- BEAM10: Beam Search with width 10
- SAHCBEAM: SAHC and BEAM mix
    
## How to Run
- ` git clone https://github.com/vikasgola/graph-search-algorithms `
- ` cd  graph-search-algorithms`
- ` python3 main.py `
